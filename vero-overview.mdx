# Receipts that prevent chargebacks.

Customers dispute transactions they don't recognize. Vero delivers itemized receipts directly to banking apps, so customers see exactly what they bought instead of cryptic merchant codes.

## The Problem

Bank statements show cryptic codes that confuse customers:

```
SQ *MAINST COFFEE      $8.47
AMZN MKTP US*2R4X      $34.99
PY *ACME SOLUTIONS     $149.00
```

Customers don't recognize these charges. They assume fraud. They dispute.

**This is friendly fraud** — legitimate purchases disputed by mistake.

  <Stat value="75%" label="Of chargebacks are non-fraudulent" />
</Stats>

## The Solution

Vero replaces cryptic codes with clear, itemized receipts inside your customers' banking apps.

When customers see what they actually purchased, they stop disputing transactions they simply forgot about.
